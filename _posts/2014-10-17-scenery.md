4c. I added ambient and direct lightning as well as set the vertices of the model to white and background to black.
4d. I also added "orbit controls" for moving around
5. I used the kickstarter for simple ui stuff like the bar and icons. And added a &lt;input&gt; field and eventlistener for file submission.
6. This step was rather about glueing the file in the input field and object loader in three js together. this took some time. the standard three.js loader expects a url so I had to dig into the code quite a bit and run the obj-file parser from outside
7. The loading of the model was done in step 6
8. The only obvious thing to do for loading of different models was to reset the scene when a new model was loaded so i added some code that removed the previos object before that.
9. Default rendering was done in step 4b so it was already done.
10. I came up with the idea of moving the initial camera position based on how big the model was.
11. Orbit controls was added in 4d, but I tested a couple of other controls examples and the only feasible alternative was the standard FPS "w,s,a,d" with camera centered mouse rotation. If there is time I might add that as a toggle switch.
