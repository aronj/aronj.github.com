1. Set up project roadmap notes
2. Downloaded revision 68 of three.js, sublime text, chrome,
set up repository on github. I also quickly decided to work remotely from the start though the kth web hosting.
3. I set up a spinning cube type hello world example from three.js website
4. I choose teapot and teddy bear from MIT and choose to wait with step 5 for now, because id rather see some successful result of adding an arbitrary model even if it was hard coded. I felt that made the process more modular in that I actually knew that this part was working.
4b. I managed to load this model with the standard object loader. Since the documentation page is "todo" this step required some in-depth research and was pretty hard. I found the files I needed to work with their loaders as it was probably intended though.
