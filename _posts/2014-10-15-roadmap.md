➔ Think about the report and log all important trials and tribulations during the process
➔ Download and set up the development environment
➔ Get a “hello world” three.js WebGL example showing
➔ Find test model
➔ Create HTML interface (“Load Model” button, title, optionally short explanation, link to
code)
➔ Print OBJ file in console (accessing model in JavaScript works)
➔ Load model in three.js
➔ Test with different models (general model loading works)
➔ Render model with default settings
➔ Research rendering options and then implement them
➔ Research 3D view controls, camera settings and then implement them
➔ Optionally polish interface, perhaps with bootstrap
➔ Refactor and minify code
➔ Upload and test on server
➔ Write report and compile the logs
