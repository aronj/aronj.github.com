1. Think about the report and log all important trials and tribulations during the process
2. Download and set up the development environment
3. Get a “hello world” three.js WebGL example showing
4. Find test model
5. Create HTML interface (“Load Model” button, title, optionally short explanation, link to code)
6. Print OBJ file in console (accessing model in JavaScript works)
7. Load model in three.js
8. Test with different models (general model loading works)
9. Render model with default settings
10. Research rendering options and then implement them
11. Research 3D view controls, camera settings and then implement them
12. Optionally polish interface, perhaps with bootstrap
13. Refactor and minify code
14. Upload and test on server
15. Write report and compile the logs
