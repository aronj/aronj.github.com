# Think about the report and log all important trials and tribulations during the process
# Download and set up the development environment
# Get a “hello world” three.js WebGL example showing
# Find test model
# Create HTML interface (“Load Model” button, title, optionally short explanation, link to code)
# Print OBJ file in console (accessing model in JavaScript works)
# Load model in three.js
# Test with different models (general model loading works)
# Render model with default settings
# Research rendering options and then implement them
# Research 3D view controls, camera settings and then implement them
# Optionally polish interface, perhaps with bootstrap
# Refactor and minify code
# Upload and test on server
# Write report and compile the logs
