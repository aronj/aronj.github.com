description: "Refactoring and Report"
---

Last chance for coffescript. I made sure almost everything had a descriptive comment in the code. Did the final polishing and refactorization of code variables.
This was mostly about making the project source code as readable as possible and making the turned in stuff as good as possible. Another big part was of course writing the report.
